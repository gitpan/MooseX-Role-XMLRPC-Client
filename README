DESCRIPTION
    This is a Moose role that provides methods and attributes needed to
    enable a class to serve as an XML-RPC client. It is parameterized
    through MooseX::Role::Parameterized, so you can customize how it embeds
    in your class. You can even embed it multiple times with different
    parameterization, if it strikes your fancy :-)

ROLE PARAMETERS
    This role generates methods and attributes depending on these
    parameters. None of them are required.

  name
    This parameter defaults to "xmlrpc". It serves as a prefix to all
    generated methods and attributes. File and URI types are coerced.

  uri (Uri)
  login_info (Bool)
  cookie_jar (File)
  traits (ArrayRef[Str])
    An arrayref of traits to apply to the attributes.

METHODS/ATTRIBUTES
    Right now, the best documentation can be found in the tests.
